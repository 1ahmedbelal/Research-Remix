      <h2>Mechanical Recycling</h2>
      <p>
        Mechanical recycling involves physical processes like shredding, washing, and re-extruding plastic. 
        Though cost-effective, repeated recycling can lead to polymer degradation which diminishes product quality. 
        Contamination from mixed materials also lowers purity and market value.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Process:</strong> Shredding, washing, re-extruding</li>
        <li><strong>Issues:</strong> Quality loss, contamination, lower market value</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Chemical Recycling</h2>
      <p>
        Chemical recycling uses chemical reactions to break polymers down into their original monomers.
        This yields higher quality materials that often retain many of their original properties. 
        However, it demands higher energy and resource input, making it more expensive and challenging to scale.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Process:</strong> Chemical breakdown into monomers</li>
        <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Retains material quality</li>
        <li><strong>Issues:</strong> High energy consumption and cost</li>
      </ul>
